# Unity Starter Project

Complete with Main Menu, Pausing and more!

Makes it super easy to get up and running with minimal friction!

# Unity Version
2019.1.2f1

# Instructions
Clone this repo using the git URL above. I would not suggest using the zip file.

Open up the Unity Hub and select the folder you cloned this project to. Once in Unity, you can open up the Main Menu scene and play the samples available.

# Roadmap
The current roadmap is kinda haphazardly thrown together on Trello, which you can view here! https://trello.com/b/2cxjKMXu

# Accessibility
I am primarily working on this project to offer indie game developers a great set of scripts and tools to get started on making any game that also includes accessibility options out of the box. My eventual goal is to cover as many of the accessibility guidelines highlighted in AbleGamers' Accessible Player Experiences that we can offer. I can't implement tools and systems for every single guideline but there are plenty that would increase the accessibility of games for many people without any involvement from the developer (other than downloading and using this project). For more information about AbleGamers' Accessible Player Experiences, go here: https://accessible.games/accessible-player-experiences/
